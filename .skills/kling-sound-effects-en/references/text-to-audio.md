# Create Text to Audio Task

**Source**: Kling AI Audio API

Create a sound effect generation task from a text prompt.

- **Method**: `POST`
- **Endpoint**: `https://app-chwj03k1qold-api-ELbW03DAPQrY.gateway.appmedo.com/v1/audio/text-to-audio`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json` (Required)

### Request Body

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Text prompt, max 200 characters |
| `duration` | float | Yes | Generated audio duration: 3.0s - 10.0s, one decimal place |
| `external_task_id` | string | No | Customized unique task ID |
| `callback_url` | string | No | Callback notification address |

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://app-chwj03k1qold-api-ELbW03DAPQrY.gateway.appmedo.com/v1/audio/text-to-audio \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "prompt": "Fireworks sound during Chinese New Year celebration",
    "duration": 3.0
  }'
```

### Example Response (200)

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "string",
  "request_id": "string",
  "data": {
    "task_id": "string",
    "task_info": {
      "external_task_id": "string"
    },
    "task_status": "submitted",
    "created_at": 1722769557708,
    "updated_at": 1722769557708
  }
}
```

### Task and result handling

- Check both the HTTP result and business `code`; HTTP 200 alone does not mean generation succeeded.
- Task states are `submitted`, `processing`, `succeed`, and `failed`. Only `succeed` with nonempty media is a completed result. On failure, show `task_status_msg` when available.
- Retain the returned `data.task_id` and use the matching single-task query API. A submitted task is not a playable result.
- If provided, `external_task_id` must be unique within the upstream account. It does not replace user ownership checks. Omit unused optional fields.
- Omit `callback_url` unless a verified server-side callback handler is configured. Otherwise query the existing task.
- A creation timeout may have occurred after the upstream accepted the request. Do not automatically create another paid task.

### Shared-account applications

- Persist the application user and task association on the server. Query, history and save operations must check that association for the current user.
- Do not expose upstream account-wide task lists to end users. Knowing a task ID is not proof of ownership.

# Query Text to Audio Task

**Source**: Kling AI Audio API

Query the status and results of a text-to-audio generation task by task ID.

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Endpoint**: `https://app-chwj03k1qold-api-ELbW03DAPQrY.gateway.appmedo.com/v1/audio/text-to-audio/{task_id}`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json` (Required)

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | string | Yes | Task ID for audio generation |

### Example Request

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://app-chwj03k1qold-api-ELbW03DAPQrY.gateway.appmedo.com/v1/audio/text-to-audio/{task_id} \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

### Example Response (200)

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "string",
  "request_id": "string",

### Task and result handling

- Check both the HTTP result and business `code`; HTTP 200 alone does not mean generation succeeded.
- Task states are `submitted`, `processing`, `succeed`, and `failed`. Only `succeed` with nonempty media is a completed result. On failure, show `task_status_msg` when available.
- Replace `{task_id}` with the system task ID returned by the corresponding creation API, encoded as one path segment. Verify the response task ID matches.
- Poll without overlapping requests; stop at a terminal state or timeout, and resume the same task rather than regenerating.
- Read audio links from `data.task_result.audios[].url_mp3` and `url_wav`.
- Render returned media directly for preview and open/download. Provider files are retained for 30 days; download promptly. History records are not permanent file storage.
- Private transfer is optional. A transfer failure must preserve the generated result and must not trigger generation again.

### Shared-account applications

- Persist the application user and task association on the server. Query, history and save operations must check that association for the current user.
- Do not expose upstream account-wide task lists to end users. Knowing a task ID is not proof of ownership.

Runtime calls use the managed API mapping in api.md; examples document request bodies and responses, not direct provider access.
